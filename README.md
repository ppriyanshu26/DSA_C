# DSA_C
Data Structures and Algorithms in C programming Language.
## Arrays
1-D and 2-D Integer and Character Arrays.
<br>
Linear and Binary Searching.
<br>
Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort Algorithms.
## Linked Lists
Singly Linked Lists.
<br>
Doubly Linked Lists.
<br>
Circular Linked Lists.
## Queues

<br>
Circular Queue implementation using Arrays and Linked Lists.
## Stacks
Stack Operations implementation using Arrays and Linked Lists.
## Hashing
A technique used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size hash codes using a hash function.
<br>
These hash codes are used to index into a data structure called a hash table, which allows for efficient data retrieval.
## Trees
